## Deployment Status

| Service | Status | URL | Health |
|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| BoardRoom AI | **Live** | `https://boardroom-ai-production-1092.up.railway.app` | `/health` → `{"status":"ok","omnimindConnected":true}` |
| OmniMind API | **Live** | `https://omnimind-api-production.up.railway.app` | `/health` → `{"status":"ok","dbConnected":true}` |
| PostgreSQL | **Live** | `postgres.railway.internal:5432` | Connected (pgvector + pg_trgm enabled) |

**Platform:** Railway (auto-deploy on push to `main`)
**Build time:** ~60 seconds per service
**Private networking:** Not yet enabled. BoardRoom → OmniMind uses public domain.

## Current Phase: SPRINT 3 (Phase 3) - Agentic Upgrades + External Cortex

The project has moved to **Sprint 3 (Phase 3)** focusing on agentic upgrades, tool use, and external cortex intelligence.

### What's Built (Phase 0 — In Progress)

**Core Infrastructure Complete:**
- Prisma schema with all entities (12+ models)
- Shared TypeScript types and Zod validation schemas
- Docker Compose dev setup
- Golden test scenarios (50+)
- Utility functions (cryptography, dates, tokens)

**Active Development (Phase 0 tasks):**
- Memory CRUD endpoints (in progress)
- Sync validation pipeline (in progress) 
- Custom agent runtime (in progress)
- Entity CRUD routes (people, goals, projects, tasks, decisions, commitments)
- Context assembler + cross-entity search

**Deferred to After Phase 3:**
- Phase 1 (Multi-Persona Intelligence): Persona prompts, parallel dispatch, CEO synthesis
- Phase 2 (Dashboard & Intelligence): Thinking pattern detection, weekly briefing, cross-project scan

### Phase 3 Focus: Agentic Upgrades + External Cortex

**Sprint 3 Tasks (300-306):**
1. **Phase 3 Types & Contracts** - Extend shared types for tool use, cortex, subscriptions
2. **Tool-Enabled Agent Runtime** - Add Anthropic SDK tool use to existing agent runtime
3. **Google Calendar Integration** - OAuth integration for memory ingestion
4. **Stripe Subscription System** - Billing, plan tiers, usage metering
5. **Cortex Intelligence Layer** - Proactive weekly memos, pattern analysis, contradiction alerts
6. **Proactive Notification System** - User notifications for insights and alerts
7. **Launch Readiness & Polish** - Final polish for v1 launch

### Infrastructure Status

**Live Services:** Both BoardRoom AI and OmniMind API are deployed and healthy on Railway
**Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector + pg_trgm enabled
**Authentication:** JWT auth with httpOnly cookies
**Rate Limiting:** In-memory (needs Redis for production scaling)

## Environment Configuration

### Railway Variables (both services configured)

| Variable | boardroom-ai | omnimind-api |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| `PORT` | auto | auto |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | — |
| `OMNIMIND_API_KEY` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `OMNIMIND_API_URL` | ✅ | — |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | ✅ |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | — | ✅ |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | auto (Railway Postgres plugin) |

## Test Suite

- **110+ tests** across both services
- Run: `npm run test` from monorepo root
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- No CI gate yet — tests are manual pre-push

## Known Limitations

1. **No CI/CD gate** — Tests and typecheck must be run manually before pushing. Railway auto-deploys on push regardless of test status.
2. **In-memory rate limiting** — Resets on restart, no cross-instance coordination.
3. **Public domain for service-to-service** — Higher latency than private networking. Switch when both services confirmed on same Railway private network.
4. **db push instead of migrations** — No rollback history. Safe for v1 with no user data; must migrate to proper migration workflow before production users exist.
5. **Subscription middleware fails open** — If OmniMind is unreachable, billing checks are skipped and all features are unlocked.
6. **No monitoring** — Only health check endpoints. No error tracking (Sentry), no metrics (Datadog/Grafana), no alerting.
7. **Single Railway instance per service** — No horizontal scaling configured.

## Git Branching

- **`main`** — Production branch. Railway auto-deploys on push.
- Development happens directly on `main`. Feature branches recommended for complex changes.
